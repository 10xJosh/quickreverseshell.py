Tired of constantly having to refer back to Pentestmonkey's reverse shell cheatsheet to get that reverse shell oneliner?
Tired of having to manually enter in your IP Address and Port number for a specifc one liner and manually having to start a netcat listener?

Well you're in luck because today, we (by we I mean me, the only person, not a group of people or anything...) are introducing a new python script that will automatically generate your reverse shell oneliner!
